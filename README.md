# Reversing Web Apps â€“ DEF CON 2025 AppSec Village Workshop

Welcome to the **Reversing Web Apps** workshop, part of the AppSec Village at **DEF CON 33 (2025)**. This workshop environment focused on reversing engineering web applications, analyzing APIs, exploiting misconfigurations, and practicing real-world web app attack vectors.

- A **React** frontend
- A **PHP** backend (API)
